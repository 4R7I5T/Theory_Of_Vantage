## 🎮 The Pacman Paradigm

We use a classic Pacman game as our testbed for consciousness research. The twist: **Pacman's brain is a spiking neural network** (300 Izhikevich neurons), while **Ghosts are feedforward MLPs** (philosophical zombies).

## 🔬 The Hard Problem

David Chalmers asked: *Why does physical processing give rise to subjective experience?*

We reformulate this as a **falsifiable question**: *Can we dissociate Function (behavior) from Phenomenology (consciousness)?*

### Our Experiments

| Test | Theory | Pacman | Ghosts | Result |
|------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| **Ignition** | GWT | ✅ 100% | 45% | PASSED |
| **Prediction** | FEP | ✅ +2.78 MMN | 0.00 | PASSED |
| **Bisection** | IIT | ❌ Reducible | — | FAILED |
| **Complexity** | PCI | ❌ 0.09 | 0.06 | FAILED |
| **Synchrony** | NCC | ⚠️ 0.88 | 0.99 | AMBIGUOUS |

## 🧟 The Zombie Proof

We attempted to create a "Philosophical Zombie" (action without consciousness) by lesioning neural pathways.

### Key Finding: Architecture Matters

| Architecture | Post-Lesion Behavior | Result |
|--------------|---------------------|--------|
| **UNIFIED** (Single Network) | 0% | 💀 Collapsed |
| **DUAL-PATHWAY** (Reflex + Cortical) | 24% | ✅ Survived |

**Conclusion:** Zombies are **only possible with modular architecture**. In integrated systems, you cannot turn off consciousness without destroying function.

## 🎯 Solving the Hard Problem

### The Insight

The Hard Problem assumes consciousness is separate from function. Our experiments show:

1. **In Unified Systems**: Function = Consciousness (same pathways)
2. **In Modular Systems**: Function ≠ Consciousness (parallel pathways)

### The Solution

The "Hard Problem" is a **category error** caused by treating all neural architectures as equivalent. The gap between function and feeling exists **only in modular systems** with redundant pathways (like the mammalian brain with subcortical bypasses).

## 🧬 The CL1 Wetware Path

Our simulations revealed a critical limitation:

| Metric | Simulation | Target | Gap |
|--------|------------|--------|-----|
| PCI | 0.09 | >0.31 | ❌ Sub-critical |
| Irreducibility | Reducible | Irreducible | ❌ Parts work alone |

**Why Simulation Fails:**
- No self-organized criticality
- No homeostatic plasticity
- No dendritic nonlinearities

**The CL1 Solution:**

*Cortical Labs CL1: 800,000 iPSC-derived human neurons on MEA*

Biological neurons naturally tune to the "edge of chaos" through:
- Metabotropic regulation
- Glial modulation
- Intrinsic channel dynamics

**Prediction:** CL1 wetware will achieve PCI > 0.31 and demonstrate true irreducibility.

## 🔮 CL1 Hypotheses: Testable Predictions

> **Important**: The following are **hypotheses**, not assumptions. Each has a rationale and a falsification condition.

### Hypothesis 1: Complexity (PCI)

| | |
|-|-|
| **Claim** | CL1 will achieve PCI > 0.31 |
| **Rationale** | Real neurons exhibit self-organized criticality through homeostatic plasticity, NMDA receptor kinetics, and glial regulation. Our simulation lacks these tuning mechanisms. |
| **If TRUE** | Biology provides something simulation lacks (criticality) |
| **If FALSE** | Either organoids lack critical architecture, or PCI theory is wrong |

### Hypothesis 2: Working Memory (Persistence)

| | |
|-|-|
| **Claim** | CL1 will show Persistence > 0.3 after stimulus offset |
| **Rationale** | NMDA receptors have ~100ms decay constants. Real neurons self-organize into attractor states. Prefrontal circuits exhibit persistent firing. |
| **If TRUE** | Biological substrate enables sustained representations |
| **If FALSE** | Working memory requires specific circuit architecture (e.g., prefrontal layers) that organoids lack |

### Hypothesis 3: Metacognition (Confidence-Accuracy)

| | |
|-|-|
| **Claim** | CL1 will show CAC > 0.5 |
| **Rationale** | Neuromodulatory systems (dopamine, norepinephrine) signal prediction errors. Hierarchical self-organization enables higher layers to monitor lower layers. |
| **If TRUE** | Biological networks can "know what they know" |
| **If FALSE** | Metacognition requires developmental experience or prefrontal-specific circuits |

### Hypothesis 4: Feature Binding (Synchrony)

| | |
|-|-|
| **Claim** | CL1 will show Binding Index > 0.6 |
| **Rationale** | Real neurons exhibit gamma-band (30-80Hz) synchronization. Gap junctions and interneuron networks provide precise temporal coordination. |
| **If TRUE** | Biological substrate enables feature integration |
| **If FALSE** | Binding requires thalamo-cortical loops absent in organoids |

## 🧪 Complete Falsification Table

| Test | Pass Threshold | Fail Threshold | If CL1 Fails |
|------|---------------|----------------|--------------|
| **PCI** | > 0.31 | < 0.31 | Wetware Imperative wrong |
| **Irreducibility** | Collapse on bisection | Linear degradation | IIT is wrong |
| **Working Memory** | > 0.3 | < 0.1 | Attractor hypothesis wrong |
| **Metacognition** | > 0.5 | < 0.2 | Self-monitoring hypothesis wrong |
| **Feature Binding** | > 0.6 | < 0.3 | Gamma synchrony hypothesis wrong |
| **Zombie Dissociation** | Behavior survives cortical lesion | Both collapse | Architecture hypothesis wrong |

### The Bottom Line

> **We're not asking "Is CL1 conscious?"** (unfalsifiable)
> 
> **We're asking "Does CL1 exhibit signatures that major theories predict?"** (falsifiable)

**If CL1 fails all tests**: The Wetware Imperative is wrong. We need different theories.

**If CL1 passes some, fails others**: We learn which theories are correct.

**If CL1 passes all tests**: Strong evidence that biological substrate provides necessary conditions for consciousness-like information processing.
